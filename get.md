## Acquiring E4S Containers

The current E4S container offerings include Docker and Singularity
images capable of running on X86_64, PPC64LE, and AARCH64 architectures.
Our full E4S Release images are based on Ubuntu 22.04. In addition to
offering a full E4S image containing a comprehensive selection of E4S
software released on a bi-annual cycle, we also offer a set of minimal
base images suitable for use in CI pipelines.

Docker images are available on the [E4S Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ecpe4s).

Please see the [E4S 25.06 Release
Notes](https://oaciss.uoregon.edu/e4s/talks/E4S_25.06.pdf).

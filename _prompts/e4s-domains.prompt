Provide an introduction to the product families supported by E4S libraries and tools.  Use https:/e4s.io as a resource for obtaining details.

The primary domains are:
1. Programming systems and tools.  Products include compilers (the LLVM stack) and portability layers like Kokkos.
2. Performance tools that identify and improve application performance, especially on large systems. Products include TAU, HPCToolkit, PAPI.
3. Math libraries that provide linear, nonlinear, transient and optimal solutions via reusable libraries. Products include PETSc, Trilinos, SuperLU.
4. Data and visualization libraries that support effecient storing and retrieval of data, pre/post and in situ analysis and display.
5. AI libraries and tools.  Products include PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Horovod.
6. Infrastructure libraries and tools. Products include Spack, containers, and cloud environments.

First produce an introductory paragraph that describes how product families are meaningful for supporting teams that use each other's libraries and tools in a cohesive way and learn about algorithmic and software advances together. Also note that, while E4S is the softwae distribution platform, product families have traditionally existed to facilitate effective and efficient development of compatible software components.

After the introduction, for each domain, provide a brief overview of the domain, the kinds of libraries and tools that are in the domain, and the kinds of application needs each domain addresses.

Finally, summarize how E4S curates all of these libraries and tools by providing a variety of testing environments including the latest CPU and GPU environments and testing for version compatibility, greatly reducing incidents due to inter-product changes that would otherwise impede smooth integration into applications and make upgrading to new versions of software harder to accomplish.

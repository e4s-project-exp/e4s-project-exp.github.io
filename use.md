E4S offers multiple methods for deploying its comprehensive collection of HPC and AI software packages. Below is an overview of these deployment options. Additional documentation is available [here](documentation.html).

## From-Source Builds

E4S utilizes [Spack](https://spack.io), a flexible package manager, to facilitate building software directly from source. This allows users to customize builds for their specific systems. Instructions: [E4S Manual Installation Guide](https://e4s-project.github.io/manual-installation.html).

## Spack Build Cache

Pre-built binaries provided via Spack build caches enable faster installations without local compilation. More information on the [E4S About Page](https://e4s-project.github.io/about.html).

## Containers

E4S offers containerized versions of its software stack, compatible with Docker, Singularity, Shifter, and CharlieCloud. See the [Downloads page](/download.html) for available containers. Containers provide portable environments across systems. E4S containers are also available via [ParaTools Pro for E4S™](https://paratoolspro.com), including [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ozpychswxmldi).

## Cloud Options

-   **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** E4S can be deployed on AWS for scalable cloud-based HPC/AI workloads. See the [E4S Home Page](https://e4s-project.github.io).
-   **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** E4S can be deployed on GCP with access to high-performance VMs and storage. See the [E4S Home Page](https://e4s-project.github.io).

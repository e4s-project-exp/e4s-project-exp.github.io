To produce an effective prompt and get the best advice for which libraries in the E4S ecosystem might work well to solve your problem, we provide a set of attributes that, if specified by you (if relevant), can permit the bot to give you the best advice.

Sample prompt:

_Advise me on solvers that can work well for a problem that ranges in size from 1 to 5 million equations, has a highly-irregular sparse patter coming from a circuit simulation problems.  The linear problem is generated by a nonlinear solver and needs to be solver to high precision.  I want only solvers with a permissive open-source license._


| Attribute | Description|
|-----------|------------|
| Problem size| Specify the size of the system (e.g., number of equations, range of sizes like small, medium, large).|
| Sparsity pattern| Describe the sparsity structure (e.g., banded, block, random, or dense) to help choose efficient methods.|
| Domain of problem| Indicate the problem domain (e.g., computational fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, etc.).|
| Sequential or family solve | Note if the solver is for a single system or a sequence of related systems (e.g., time stepping).|
| Accuracy requirements| Specify the desired precision or error tolerance (e.g., high precision, low precision).|
| Memory constraints| Indicate memory limitations (e.g., low memory availability, need for in-place solvers).|
| Parallelism needs| State if the problem needs to be solved on multiple cores, GPUs, or distributed systems.|
| Solver preference| Mention any preference for direct or iterative methods, or a specific library (e.g., PETSc, Trilinos).|
| Preconditioning| Specify if preconditioners are needed and any known preconditioning options (e.g., ILU, AMG).|
| Convergence criteria| Define the criteria for convergence (e.g., residual threshold, max iterations).|
| Problem scaling| State if the problem is well-scaled or ill-conditioned, influencing the solver choice.|
| Solver robustness| Indicate if robustness is more important than speed (e.g., handling ill-conditioned systems).|
| Software environment| Specify any constraints related to software (e.g., must run in specific environments like E4S or Spack).|
| Ease of use vs performance | Specify if the user prioritizes ease of setup or maximum performance tuning.|
| Solver reuse| Indicate if the solver setup will be reused across multiple solves (e.g., factorization reuse).|
| Customization needs| Mention if custom solver parameters or advanced features are needed (e.g., specific matrix formats).|
| Known solver limitations| Describe any known limitations or requirements (e.g., solver must handle non-symmetric matrices).|
| Hardware specifics| Provide details about the hardware where the solver will run (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory bandwidth).|
| Licensing constraints| Indicate if the solver needs to be open-source, commercial, or compatible with specific licenses.|
| Community support| Mention if strong community or documentation is important for solver choice.|

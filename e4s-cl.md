### E4S container management tool: E4S-CL

E4S Container Launch is an effort to facilitate the use of MPI
applications developed using E4S containers on supercomputers without
having to compile a new binary on the host.

Given a combination of an MPI library, a container and a MPI binary, E4S
Container Launch will run the MPI binary in the target container using
the MPI library. This is useful when the binary has been compiled using
a different library than the one passed as an argument: as long as the
two libraries are [ABI compatible](https://www.mpich.org/abi/), the
binary will run under the new environment.

E4S Container Launch includes tools to automatically detect the MPI
binary\'s necessary files, making it seamless to set up and use.

The source code is available at the [E4S-CL GitHub
repository](https://github.com/E4S-Project/e4s-cl). The documentation is
also available [here](https://e4s-cl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

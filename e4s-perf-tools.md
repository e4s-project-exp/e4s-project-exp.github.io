### Overview  
This product family covers profiling, tracing, instrumentation, hardware counters, and runtime measurement tools that help users discover performance bottlenecks and guide optimization, especially at extreme scale.

### Core libraries/tools  
- **TAU** (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) for instrumentation, tracing, and performance measurement
- **HPCToolkit** for sampling, call-path attribution, and performance analysis
- **PAPI** (Performance API) for access to hardware performance counters and event measurement
- Complementary tools and subsystems (e.g. Caliper, DynInst) found in the E4S product listing  

### Application needs addressed  
- Hotspot detection: which routines, kernels, or loops consume disproportionate amounts of time or stall due to memory or synchronization  
- Scalability diagnosis: identify bottlenecks in communication, load imbalance, serialization, or contention  
- Performance regression detection: comparing versions or configurations to validate changes  
- Hardware-counter–driven insight into memory bandwidth, cache utilization, instruction mix, and other metrics

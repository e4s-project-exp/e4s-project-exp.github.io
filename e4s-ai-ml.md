This product family addresses frameworks and tools for training, inference, and distributed scaling of AI/ML methods in scientific workflows, particularly in hybrid HPC + AI settings.

### Core libraries/tools  
- **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, **JAX** for deep learning and numerical modeling   
- **Horovod** for distributed training across MPI / GPUs 
- Supporting frameworks for model serving, large-scale inference (e.g. VLLM), integration with HPC interconnects and data pipelines (e.g. Hugging Face tools) in recent E4S releases 

### Application needs addressed  
- Neural network model development (training and validation) integrated with HPC-scale compute  
- Inference and deployment in scientific pipelines (e.g. surrogate modeling, data-driven surrogates, physics-informed nets)  
- Scaling across nodes and GPUs, leveraging MPI or other communication layers  
- Co-execution with simulation codes (e.g. embedding models within PDE solvers)
